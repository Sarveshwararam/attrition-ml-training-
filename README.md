# Project Overview
Employee attrition can be costly. By predicting which employees are at risk of leaving, organizations can implement retention strategies and reduce turnover. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

# Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and selection
- Multiple machine learning models for prediction
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Predict attrition for new employee data

# Dataset
The dataset includes:
- Demographics (age, gender, marital status)
- Job role and department
- Work experience and education
- Salary, incentives, and performance metrics
- Historical attrition labels
